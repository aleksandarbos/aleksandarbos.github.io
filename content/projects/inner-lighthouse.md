## Project details

Inner Lighthouse is cross-platform mobile app for daily self-reflection exercises. The app development with itself has brought many technical challenges such as:

- Implemented a custom, responsive Duolingo-style journey layout using a tailored sin/cos function, ensuring cross-platform consistency across various mobile screen sizes.

- Engineered a complex payment system with platform-specific code for Android and iOS, handling diverse local currencies and data extraction intricacies.

- Designed and implemented a robust architecture prioritizing user privacy, safeguarding identity even in the event of a security breach.

- Utilized React, Redux+Sagas for state management, with AWS (Lambdas, S3) for backend services. Implemented GraphQL API using Graphene, streamlining data fetching for the React app.

- Established a microservices architecture with Terraform for deployment, showcasing DevOps proficiency.
