Summary: Worked on implementation of WPF-based code generator for Schneider Electric's WebDMD platform...

Developed and implemented a WPF-based code generator for Schneider Electric's WebDMD platform, automating the creation of 10+ code layers for complex enterprise solutions. Designed an intuitive GUI tool enabling high-level management to perform real-time client customizations, drastically reducing field integration time from weeks to minutes. Contributed to multi-layer code generation, integration features, and ongoing platform maintenance.

This solution significantly **enhanced scalability, reduced development costs, and improved client satisfaction**. The tool allowed for rapid customization of multiple fields simultaneously, streamlining enterprise-level modifications and substantially decreasing project turnaround times while maintaining code quality and consistency.
