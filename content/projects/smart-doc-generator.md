## Smart Document Generator

Open Law Library is a DC-based startup (NGO) aiming to make the law widely accessible to all for free in a high-quality format.

As this was indeed a complex library, here are some of the key aspects I've faced:

- Implemented highly optimized recursive algorithms and handlers in Python for XML processing

- Optimized and profiled Python handlers for high-volume data transformation, enabling generation of thousand-page documents

- Employed Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure high quality and transformation accuracy

- Created a Bidirectional XML Transformer with Round-Trip Integrity (`XML â†” DOCX`), synchronizing parser and transformer components, putting high emphasis on data integrity checks

- Extended python-docx library with custom features adhering to OOXML standard, including support for content controls with public contributions: [https://github.com/openlawlibrary/python-docx](https://github.com/openlawlibrary/python-docx)

As all input data is in the public domain, you can see example: [https://github.com/DCCouncil/law-xml](https://github.com/DCCouncil/law-xml)
